Plays spider solitaire - Depth first search with heuristic

An attepmt at solving spider solatiare. Turns out this game has a rather large complexity (and this solution empoys are rather basic heuristic) ergo this does not ever get to solve the problem in a reasonable time. 
This white paper shows the game is NP-Complete and highlights it's complexity: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.1052.pdf

Technique:
Uses bradth first search with an huristic on points based. 
Since I don't play the game enough, the heuristic used was rather basic points based system.
